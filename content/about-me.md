# Hi! I'm Todor Kostov

I am a developer with around 6 years of experience in developing Android applications. Currently, I am based in Sofia, Bulgaria.

I graduated with BSc degree in Computer Science from University College of Northern Denmark (UCN) in 2015. If you are still interested in my background, you can check my CV [**here**](https://kostovtd.notion.site/Resume-bbb6ac5f1f1e4463a11210543ac1c6eb).

In my spare time I like reading books, doing sports and hanging out with friends. 

If you are searching for some great fantasy books, I highly recommend you to check Brandon Sanderson's work!

In case you want to get in touch with me, share some ideas & thoughts or just want to invite me for a beer, you can always write me an email on <ins>**kostovtdATgmail.com**</ins> or follow me on Twitter <ins>**ATkostovtd**</ins>.
