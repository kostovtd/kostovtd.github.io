[{"content":"Originally published on 11/16/2016\nWorking with Gradle through Android Studio is fairly easy and pleasant thing. But sometimes, you will need to build your projects on a machine without Android Studio. Gradle can be really helpful during that process and can automatically download any missing SDK packages as long as the accepted license agreement for them is in place. If it is missing, then you will have a problem.\nHow to find the license agreement? Finding the agreement is fairly easy:\nSwitch to the machine which has the Android Studio installed. Go to Tools \u0026gt; Android \u0026gt; SDK Manager. Copy the Android SDK Location path. Go to the directory from step 3. Copy licenses/ directory to the machine you want to build your project on. What is in licenses/ ? There is just a single file, usually called android-sdk-license. If you open it with any text editor, you will see a relatively long kind of a key. That folder is automatically generated when you accept any license agreement through the SDK Manager.\nWhen will we need that? The most obvious case for me is when you are trying to integrate your project into any kind of a Continuous Integration system like Bamboo, Jenkins, etc. and that integration is being done one a different machine.\nResources: https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/update.html#download-with-gradle Feel free to share, comment \u0026amp; give your opinion on the topic!\n","permalink":"https://kostovtd.com/posts/gradle-license-agreement/","summary":"Originally published on 11/16/2016\nWorking with Gradle through Android Studio is fairly easy and pleasant thing.

They provide a great way of navigating to different screens through our app. And in order to use tabs, we have to work with something call a ViewPager. According to the official documentation, this is a layout manager that allows us to flip left and right through pages of data. These pages of data are usually composed of Fragments. And in order to increase the performance and efficiency of the application, the views of each fragment / tab, which is off-screen, can be destroyed. The idea is to keep as little information in memory as possible. Sometimes this optimization can lead to problems, if the number of off-screen tabs is not set properly. User input can be lost, views\u0026rsquo; state can be reset, etc. Thus, we need to carefully choose that number of off-screen tabs.\nHow can we do that? By default, the number of off-screen tabs is set to 1. This means that there can be 1 tab to the left and 1 tab to the right of the currently visible tab, which will be kept in memory. Changing that value is fairly easy.\nmViewPager.setOffScreenPageLimit(limit)\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all we need.

So here is the first and hopefully not the last post on the vast field of Android Development!\nAs developers, we sometimes have the awesome privilege to work on something really interesting for us like geofencing, another cool and good looking animation, face recognition or something else. But that\u0026rsquo;s not always the case. During our everyday work we have to make a bunch of Activity classes with almost always the same lifecycle methods in them or RecyclerView adapters which implement the same ViewHolder pattern and that gets really tedious and boring (ooh and not to forget the fragments). And all that source code usually follows some kind of a pattern. Thus, having some predefined templates for these tasks sounds like a good idea.\nThere are several advantages of having such predefined templates:\nTime saving - always spending 2 or 3 minutes just to override the basic lifecycle methods of an Activity or a Fragment can add up really fast when you have to do that multiple times a day. And doing that for a RecyclerView adapter takes even longer. At the end of the day, time is money, right?\nEnforcing coding conventions - we all know the benefits of following coding conventions during the development process. Although, it is a small thing, at least the overall structure of your Activities, Fragments and other components will look the same, no matter who is their author.\nFlexibility - the templates are really flexible and it\u0026rsquo;s only up to you the modify them in the way most suitable for your current team or project.\nHow to create a template? Creating a template is actually really simple:\nStep 1: Go to Settings Step 2: Find Editor -\u0026gt; File and Code Templates Step 3: Create the actual templat In order to be able to choose a template each time you create a new class, enum, interface etc. add the template you want under the Files tab in the main section of the pop-up window from Step 2. Adding a new entry under this tab is easy - just click the green plus sign above Files.\nDown bellow you will find two examples of the templates, which I am currently using. They are written to meet my personal preferences, thus I am not completely sure that they will suit you, but at least you can have an idea of how to make them. (honestly, it\u0026rsquo;s not rocket science)\nHere you can find a link to the rest of the templates that I am currently using.\nFeel free to share, comment \u0026amp; give your opinion on the topic!\n","permalink":"https://kostovtd.com/posts/code-templates/","summary":"Originally published on 10/30/2016\nAfter thinking about launching a blog for Android for near a month, finally I decided to do it!

These are all great ice cream flavors! Especially the first two! But because of the cold weather outside, we are not going to talk about ice cream. Instead, we will talk about one of the great features of the Android Gradle plugin called Flavors.\nWhat are Flavors? The idea behind that feature is relatively simple. It provides version customization possibilities. In other words, we can provide different version of the same application with some minor differences. Based on that, a single project can have multiple different flavors.\nWhy do we need them? There are several reasons for using flavors. For me, the most obvious one is when you want to develop a white-label product. In Wikipedia the term is described in the following way:\nA white label product is a product or service produced by one company (the producer) that other companies (the marketers) rebrand to make it appear as if they had made it.\nIf we try to relate that description to the mobile world, we can use the idea of RSS readers as an example. Imagen we have an application which can consume such a feed. Somehow we managed to sell that app to \u0026lsquo;New York Times\u0026rsquo;, but then \u0026lsquo;The Guardian\u0026rsquo; wants a RSS reader as well. Instead of writing the whole application from the ground bottom, we can just create a new flavor of the version we currently have, change the UI layer, align the feed tags with the one used by the guys from \u0026lsquo;The Guardian\u0026rsquo; and sell the app to them as well. And so the application / product we have is a white-labeling product.\nHow to use them? As mentioned previously, that feature is provided by the Android Gradle plugin. Thus, whenever we want to work with flavors we have to edit the Gradle files in our project. To be more precise, we need to make changes in our build.gradle file.\nDefining a new flavor is easy:\nEach and every new flavor has to be included in the productFlavors block. After defining our flavors we can check them from the Build Variants panel (View \u0026gt; Tool Windows \u0026gt; Build Variants).\nEach defined flavor has the same properties as the defaultConfig. Everything described in the defaultConfig block can be used in a flavor block as well. This is because the defaultConfig actually belongs to the ProductFlavor class. The defaultConfig block can be found in your build.gradle file.\nThe properties and methods which can by used inside of a newly defined flavor are actually a lot. They are described in the ProductFlavor class mentioned above. Some of them are:\napplicationId versionName versionCode buildConfigField (type, name, value) minSdkVersion / maxSdkVersion Most of them are self explanatory, but applicationId and buildConfigField are not. The applicationId property sets the id of the application. Surprise! Surprise! But why do we need to assign a new id to our flavor? There are several reasons for doing that, but one of them is the fact that you can not have two applications with the same id on a single devices. Thus, by giving a new id to your flavor you can actually keep two separate installations on your app on the same devices. That\u0026rsquo;s useful for testing and when doing demos.\nThe buildConfigField method is useful when you want to predefine particular build configurations to your flavor. These configurations can vary in type, name and value. For example, that\u0026rsquo;s useful when your flavors are using different host addresses for server communication and in many other situations.\nLately you can access the values predefined in the buildConfigField method from Java in the following way: BuildConfig.HOST\nSource code and resources: Although, the flavors are relatively similar, there are some small differences between them as well. These differences can be related to the source code, the drawable resources, the assets, etc. But they all share one base set of Java code, icons, strings and so on. Happily, the Android Gradle plugin can give us some hints on how to structure all the folders for our flavors. There is a handy task which will create a small report, based on the flavors we have. In the report you will find the exact path and naming for the important folders and files (java, res, assets, Manifest, etc.) for each flavor.\nTo generate this report do the following:\nClick Gradle on the right side of the IDE window. Navigate to MyApplication \u0026gt; Tasks \u0026gt; Android and double click sourceSets. To view the report, click Gradle Console at the bottom of the IDE window. This report can be really useful, because of the fact that Android Studio does NOT create the needed source set directories for each flavor.\nBuild variants VS Flavors If you know a thing or two about build variants and flavors, but the distinction between these two entities is still not clear in your head, I highly recommend you to go through the following StackOverflow discussion - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27905934/why-are-build-types-distinct-from-product-flavors\nResources: http://blog.brainattica.com/how-to-work-with-flavours-on-android/ https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants.html https://objectpartners.com/2015/03/31/using-android-product-flavors-to-build-full-and-demo-version-of-the-app https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-label_product Feel free to share, comment \u0026amp; give your opinion on the topic!\n","permalink":"https://kostovtd.com/posts/flavors/","summary":"Originally published on 11/20/2016\nBanana, blueberries, cherry, coffee, cream.

Thus, I had to spend several hours in order to figure out how to do it.\nBut first, let me show you the main idea!\nOn the picture down below you can see just a regular TabLayout. The whole width of the layout is separated equally between the three tabs and there is no margin at all between them.\nOn the second picture you can see the desired result. The margins between the tabs are present.\nAt the end, I came up with the following solution:\nCode description: In general, the main idea of the code snippet above is to get each tab as a View and to add margin to it. The tricky part is how to actually get the tabs one by one. If we go through the source code of the TabLayout class, we will notice that each and every time we add a new tab to the TabLayout, that tab is being included in a SlidingTabStrip. Thus, the strip is the container of all the tabs we have. The good news is that it\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy to reach the SlidingTabStip, because it\u0026rsquo;s the first child of the TabLayout. And after that we can easily add margins to the tab views in the usual way.\nFeel free to share, comment \u0026amp; give your opinion on the topic!\n","permalink":"https://kostovtd.com/posts/add-margins-between-tabs/","summary":"Originally published on 11/02/2016\nTabs\u0026hellip; Almost each and every application has at least one screen with tabs.

This single source contains probably the biggest dataset of questions and answers on different programming topics. Talking in numbers, currently there are more than 13 000 000 questions posted on Stackoverflow and more than 930 000 of them are related to Android.\nStackoverflow is the first place, where I seek help and advice regarding the issues I face during the day. Time is money! Thus there is no reason for you to go and reinvent the wheel. If you are stuck with something, just check if someone else had faced that issue before. The chances are high that you will find what you are looking for.

Otherwise, you will have to deal with some down voting and hatred.

Why not just using the normal AVD? Because I don\u0026rsquo;t like it! Things have probably changed since my last use of the AVD, but I still remember the time when it was really really slooooow. I had to wait long time just to boot the virtual device and some of it\u0026rsquo;s features were crappy. Then I found Genymotion.
